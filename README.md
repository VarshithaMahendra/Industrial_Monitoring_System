# üè≠ Industrial Monitoring System

A real-time industrial safety monitoring system built using the LPC1768 microcontroller. This project integrates various sensors and embedded logic to detect critical safety conditions and automatically trigger emergency actions.

## üöÄ Overview

This system is designed to monitor key safety parameters in an industrial environment:
- Helmet compliance (IR sensor)
- Overheating (LM35 temperature sensor)
- Fire detection (flame sensor)

When any hazard is detected, the system:
- Activates a buzzer for alert
- Automatically opens a door using a DC motor and relay
